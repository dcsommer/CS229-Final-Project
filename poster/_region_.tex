              We descibe a probablistic graphical model for
              \alert{predicting future communications} in a social network
              given communications from the past.

                      profiles
                    \item Assign score to link as opposed to
                      probability distribution
                    \item Difficult to extract general relationships
                      within network

         \noindent{\textbf{Overview}}\par
          Allows us to \alert{incorporate structure} of social graph of
             the training data by assigning a $\gamma_{ij}(Y_{ij})$
         \vskip1ex
         \noindent{\textbf{Method}}\par
         Define $\gamma_{ij}(Y_{ij})$ for $1 \le i \le j \le n$ by:
         \begin{itemize}
         \item $\gamma_{ij}(0) = 1$
         \item $\gamma_{ij}(1) = 1 + score(i,j)$

         Various $score(i,j)$ definitions:
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Common Neighbors Score
           \item Jaccard coefficient score
           \item Zero Score (Uniform)
           \end{itemize}
      \end{block}

      \begin{block}{Triangle Template Potentials}
         \noindent{\textbf{Overview}}\par
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Use training data as \alert{instantiation of unrolled
          network} to observe $Y_{ij}$ then complete data using $C_i = c_i^* = \arg\max_{c_i} \phi_i(c_i)$ for every $i$.
          \item Gradient ascent for parameters of $\psii(c_i,c_j,y)$
            intractable since it requires inference over the joint assignment to all
         variables in $\mathcal X$. 
        \end{itemize}inference
         \vskip1ex
         \noindent{\textbf{Method 1}}\par
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Used \alert{hard assignment} to $\phi_i(C_i)$ since
             potentials usually assign high probability to a single class.
           \item Gradient of (conditional) likelihood becomes more tractable:
          \[ \frac {\partial} {\partial w_{c_1, c_2, y}} \frac 1 M \ell(\bm \theta : \mathcal D) = \frac 1 M M[c_1, c_2, y] - P(c_1, c_2, y) \]
           \item No inference or gradient ascent by setting to 0.
         \end{itemize}
         \vskip1ex
         \noindent{\textbf{Method 2}}\par
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Network distribution is represented as 
             \[ P(\mathcal X) = \frac 1 {Z} \left( \prod_i \phi_i(C_i) \right) \left( \prod_{i < j} \psi(C_i, C_j, Y_{ij}) \right) \left( \prod_{i < j} \gamma_{ij}(Y_{ij})) \right)\]
           \item Structure creates correspondence between
             $\phi(C_i,C_j,Y_{ij})$ and $P(Y_{ij} | C_i, C_j)$
           \item Learn $\bm \theta$ as entires of CPD for $P(Y |
             C_i,C_j)$

        \item Achieved result close to graph-structure based link predictors
        \item Experiments show that success of prediction comes from

         \item Model preserves information
          \item \alert{Adding classifications of people does not significantly
          add to predictive power}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item May be because Email is poor indicator of useful
              class partitioning

        \vskip1ex
        \noindent{\textbf{Future Work}}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Try with features of email that may be more indicitive
            of future communications
          \item Try in domain that has \alert{more direct features} of who a
            person may communicate with
            \begin{itemize}
              \item Facebook information would allow for application
                to social network structure as well as indicitive
                features of each person including location, school,
                interests, etc.
            \end{itemize}
          \item Test model in scenario where limited amounts of test
            data are observable
